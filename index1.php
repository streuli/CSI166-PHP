<h2>Welcome to a J.D. Salinger Fan Club</h2>

    Gary Kildall's story is fascinating but also sad in many ways. He contributed so much to early computing with his creations like BIOS and CP/M, yet he doesn't get the recognition he deserves. 
    It’s unfortunate that the IBM deal didn’t work out and that myths like the “flying” story overshadow his achievements. It’s good that some sources are setting the record straight, showing that 
    he was more than just the guy who missed out on a big moment. His innovations shaped personal computing, and it's unfortunate that bitterness and personal struggles later affected his life.
